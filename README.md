I created my logo at [https://www.picmonkey.com]

I wanted the logo to feel handmade so I hand drew yellow flowers, which match the purple and yellowish green theme I have on my website. 

# Description
**Adding HTML, Images, and Links**
<div>
This is the very first thing I learned to do for my project. In this section I learned how to add an image to my webpage by linking it with "img src".
</div>

**Setting up GitHub and Netlify**
<div>
 I learned how to set up GitHub and Netlify which were crucial for my project. I learned how to connect my GitHub repo to VS Code and push and pull my changes so that they appear on Netlify
</div>

**Learning Customization through CSS**
<div>Learning how to customize my webpage through CSS was so fun! I learned properties like

* background-color
* font-family
* color
* padding
* box-shadow

that allowed me to design my webpage how I pleased. 
</div>

**Adding Photos to My Photo Gallery**
<div>I learned how to resize my images and how to style them in CSS. Through CSS I was able to change the photo layout from being a row into being a column depending on size. I also learned how to use figcaption to add a description to my images.
</div>

**Learning How to Embed Media**
<div>For this part of the webpage we were told to embed a video. I learned how to use "iframe" to embed my YouTube video into my webpage. I also learned how to adjust the width and height within the iframe so that the video could be the size I wanted AND I learned how to enable fullscreen mode. 
</div>


**Learning How to Use Create Webforms**
<div>Towards the end of the project I learned how to create a webform that could actually submit the information that was typed into it! I used properties like:

* label for=
* select id=
* option value=
* legend

to create the form

I also learned how to use "ul" to create different options for the responses to the questions.
</div>


**Creating the Navbar**
<div>The Navbar was created so that people who visit my site can quickly access the sections they need to without having to scroll. I learned how to link the code to the specific sections on my webpage so that when the word "Biography" is clicked, it will take the use to my biography.
</div>

# Color Scheme
For the color scheme, I wanted to create a webpage that would pop. I used [https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel] to find colors that I liked and colors that complimented each other. 

For the main dark purple background, I used #7B4CAD. For the lighter purple accents, I used #BF87FA. For the text, I used #FAFA87, a light green, almost yellowish color. 

<img width="1280" alt="Screenshot 2023-09-27 160117" src="https://github.com/RVCC-IDMX/about-me-PrincessChicken/assets/145609559/bc86adf2-9dce-463b-ba82-f373d4f81aa3">

I use a lot of dotted borders in my code and the original color for it was going to be the #ADAD3B. But, I discovered that it didn't really go that well with the purple and decided to use a bright yellow instead. So for each of the dotted borders, the color is (255, 255, 0).
